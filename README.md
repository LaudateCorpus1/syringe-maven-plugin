# Syringe Maven Plugin

Supporting Maven plugin for [Syringe](https://github.com/avast-open/syringe "Syringe") dependency injection and 
configuration library. It was developed at [AVAST Software](http://www.avast.com "AVAST Software").

The plugin generates so-called __palette__ (module) out of the components (config beans) in your project. The __palette__ 
can then be used to wire the components and configure them.

More information can be found in [Syringe wiki](https://github.com/avast-open/syringe/wiki "Syringe wiki").
